                                    When writing a persuasive speech or letter, it is important to consider your
                                    audience. Include facts, details, and examples that your audience will connect with.
                                    For example, consider your audience’s background knowledge to include any
                                    information they need to know. Consider your audience’s prior experiences to include
                                    related examples that will appeal to their emotions.
