                    They would sit on each arm of my chair and listen to me
                    tell them about my life back in Arkansas. I didn’t hold
                    back nothing. I told them about haunted houses, ghosts,
                    robbers, bank holdups, tornadoes, snakes, tarantulas,
                    times when the river flooded and we had to float on a
                    rooftop to save our lives. Lordy, worman, they just
                    <strong>ate it up.</strong> They would listen to me with
                    their eyes as big as <strong>saucers</strong>. I don’t
                    quite know why I done it, but I asked the girls not to
                    tell their mother about my stories. They were as secretive
                    as little private detectives until a week ago. They got so
                    excited over one of my stories that they forgot
                    theirselves. I was busy in the kitchen putting some
                    homemade noodles into a pot of chicken broth. I heard Pat
                    tell her Mother, ‘Mom, back in Arkansas where Neffie used
                    to live, they are wormans that can tell fortunes for
                    people. They can look right through your face and tell if
                    you are telling the truth or a lie. They can rub your
                    <strong>warts</strong> with skunk oirl and say some words
                    and all the warts will fall off, never ever come back.’ I
                    figured I was in bad trouble, but I kept on dropping the
                    noodles into the broth. I was a hundred percent right
                    about the trouble.
